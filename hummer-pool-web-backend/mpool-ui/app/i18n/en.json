    "qa": "FAQs",
    "q1": "How to calculate to know whether your income is correct?",
    "a1": "After the user logs in, the previous hashrates can be obtained in the Hummer Pool-user panel-30-day hashrate chart. Click and turn to the pool income calculator page, select the current degree of difficulty, enter the hashrate data, then you can calculate the theoretical income of the current hashrate (in PPS mode). The PPS mode is the theoretical basis for the current mining revenue calculation. The PPS income plus the net’s average miner's fee is the theoretical mining output in FPPS mode, and the user will get his deserved income after deducting the miner's fee. If your revenues are reduced because of the mining pool itself, the mining pool will compensate you more than the amount of income loss.",
    "q2": "Why didn't I receive the payment?",
    "a2": "Have you filled in the income address? Have you updated the income address in the last 48-72 hours? Is the income balance reaching the minimum amount? Is the mining pool paying you right now",
    "q3": "When is the daily income of the previous day settled?",
    "a3": "Hummer Pool calculates the mining revenue according to UTC 0:00-24:00, for example, from 8:00 am Beijing time yesterday to 8:00 am today. Hummer Pool generates bills every day at 8:00 am-8:30 am Beijing time, and usually pays at 10:00 am-12:00 am. In case of special circumstances, there will be a delay in the payment.",
    "q4": "Why does the income of mining fluctuate or decrease?",
    "a4": "The fluctuation of mining revenue is mainly affected by the change of hashrate and difficulty adjustment.  Hashrate change: The output of hashrate during the mining process fluctuates. Coupled with the impact of power, network, the status of mining machine, etc., the hashrate will have a large fluctuation, resulting in changes in revenue. Difficulty adjustment: The difficulty of the whole network of encrypted digital currency will be adjusted after a period of time, the overall difficulty level is mainly increasing. It is normal that the income decreases while maintaining the original hashrate.",
    "q5": "When will I receive the payment after I change my wallet address?",
    "a5": "In order to ensure the security of the user account, for users who modify the payment address, Hummer Pool will freeze the account for 48 hours and clear the account at the next settlement time. Since the mine bill settlement time is 8:00 am Beijing time every day, the user who modifies the address after 8:00 am will be postponed to the third day for payment. As for the time of receipt of the payment, the collection time varies due to factors such as the volume of transactions in different currency networks. The user can go to the income page of Hummer Pool to see if the proceeds have been paid, and then go to the receiving wallet or the exchange to confirm whether the proceeds have been paid.",
    "q6": "Will the earnings be lost without setting the payment address?",
    "a6": "First of all, your earnings will not be lost. If you do not fill in the payment address, your earnings will be temporarily stored in the Hummer Pool account. After you set the address, Hummer Pool will pay you the proceeds after the address takes effect.",
